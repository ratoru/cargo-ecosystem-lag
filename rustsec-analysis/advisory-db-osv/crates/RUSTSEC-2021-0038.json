  "summary": "Multiple memory safety issues",
  "details": "Affected versions contain multiple memory safety issues, such as:\n\n - Setting a multi label type where an image doesn't exist would lead to a NULL pointer dereference.\n - Setting a window icon using a non-raster image (which FLTK rasterizes lazily) would lead to a NULL dereference.\n - Pixmap constructor would not check for correct pixmaps which could lead to out-of bound reads.",
